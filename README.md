## Configurable Workflow Engine (State-Machine API) 

### What this is

Backend service to:
- Define workflows using states and transitions (actions)
- Start workflow instances
- Move instances between states using valid actions
- Inspect definitions and running instances

Everything runs in-memory. No database or file storage.

## Limitations
- No authentication or authorization
- No local storage or database (in-memory only)
- No file persistence
- No pagination or filtering
- No unit tests

## Assumptions
- All data is lost on restart
- Only basic validation is done
- Minimal comments and TODOs

## What next?
- Add authentication and user roles
- Add local storage or simple database
- Add persistence (save/load workflows)
- Add more validation and error handling
- Add tests
- Add pagination/filtering for large lists
